# The World that Remains
## An Urban Fantasy Setting for Basic Fantasy RPG.
The World that Remains is a unique Urban Fantasy setting for Chris Gonnerman's *Basic Fantasy RPG* taking inspiration from a certain video game adaptation of Bram Stoker's *Dracula* (whose second game "borrowed" boxart from the cover of a game module whose catagorical identification is I6) and an American web cartoon series where the main power source is brightly colored crystallized magic. In this setting, you will go up against both the forces of evil in any form they take. This supplement relies off of the Basic Fantasy Core Rules, the PDF is found for free at basicfantasy.org.
