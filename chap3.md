# Chapter 3 - Equipment
This chapter is designed to best equip up and coming Wardens in all their tasks.

## Starting Money
The World that Remains runs off of a gold coin economy. To determine how much money you have, roll 3d6 and multiply the result by ten. Refer to the *Basic Fantasy Equipment Emporium* for a list of things you can buy in any city or town in the world.

## Weaponry
> "Looking at a weapon, you can learn much more about someone. From how worn down it looks, to what the weapon consists of." 
-Sapphire Sakura, Warden-in-Training at Beacon's Cross HQ.

A Warden's weapon does speak words about the Warden who holds it. Each one is lovingly crafted by its wielder. Some have balanced theirs out to have multiple attack modes. These weapons are called Multiweapons.

### Crafting a Multiweapon
If you opt for a multiweapon, you will start with four weapon points. Consider the following chart for costs based on weapon sizes.

| Size | Cost |
|------|------|
| Small | 1 |
| Medium | 2 |
| Large | 3 |

Firearms are not mentioned in the supplement, but are equated as the following:

| Firearm | Weapon Equivalent |
|---------|-------------------|
| Pistol | Sling (S) |
| Shotgun | Bola (M) |
| Sniper Rifle | Balista (Point Cost Equivalent: L) |

## Cesarium Wands
For those who do not wish to take a traditional weapon, you can commission a Cesarium Wand, which turns a small quantity of Cesarium to provide support effects to your allies. A Cesarium Wand costs 100 Gold and takes two weeks to craft. Each Cesarium Wand holds one cartridge of Powdered Cesarium and one day must be used to clean the chamber of the wand thoroughly before swapping Cesarium types.

Cesarium is touched on in the next chapter.

## Cesarium Cartridges
An expensive commodity. While Cesarium is commonplace, Warden use cartidges cost quite a bit. To the GM: Determine the Wolf's Snarl threat level as seen in Chapter 5. Multiply the threat by 1d6. If the player takes a Cesarium Wand, assume one cartridge of the player's choice of Cesarium comes with.
