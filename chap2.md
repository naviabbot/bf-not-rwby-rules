# Chapter 2: Creating a Character
Most of this guide is similar to the rules on how to do so for standard *Basic Fantasy*. The only difference is races and classes.

## Races
### Humans
Humans are a very versatile group of people. Each land has their own unique culture and view of the world around them. Every year, one nation invites all who live in the world to share ideas and culture with others in a large festival that often pits its top Upcoming "Not-Huntsmen" in non-lethal sport.

**Restrictions**: Humans can be any class they desire. To be a human, your ability scores must all be nine or above.

**Perks**: As Humans can adjust to nearly anything swiftly, they gain a 10% bonus to any experience gained.

### Lycankind
People who have the ability to morph into creatures.

### Dhampir
The forbidden offspring between Humans and Vampires. Often leaning towards chaotic and forge their own path from there. Afflicted with a vampire's celerity, strength, and bloodlust; however can be harmed by normal weapons.

### Nephilim
The offspring between the Angelic and Humans from long ago. The offspring of these offspring will always be Nephilim and align heavily against the Shadows of Despair. One can tell them apart from normal humans from their glowing eyes in battle against these foul monsters.

**Restrictions**: Nephilim are best as Rangers or Fighters.

**Perks**: TBW

## Classes
Most of the classes are played as is, with the exception of Cleric and Magic-User. Due to the constraints of the setting, these classes do not exist. Instead, Fighters and Thiefs will be able to use Magic via the use of Cesarium, a commonly found crystal that reflects the environment where it was grown in both color and effect. More on Cesarium can be found later.

This setting was written with the use of the [Ranger](https://basicfantasy.org/downloads/BF-Rangers-and-Paladins-r4.pdf) and [Scout](https://basicfantasy.org/downloads/BF-Scouts-Supplement-r4.pdf) subclasses and [Assassin](https://basicfantasy.org/downloads/BF-Assassins-Supplement-r5.pdf) in addition to Thief and Fighter in mind. Each supplement is also hyperlinked above and can be found on the downloads page of basicfantasy.org. If your GM permits, you might be able to use any other non-magic using class.
