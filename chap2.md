# Chapter 2: Creating a Character
Most of this guide is similar to the rules on how to do so for standard *Basic Fantasy*. The only difference is races and classes.

## Races
### Humans
Humans are a very versatile group of people. Each land has their own unique culture and view of the world around them. Every year, one nation invites all who live in the world to share ideas and culture with others in a large festival that often pits its top Upcoming "Not-Huntsmen" in non-lethal sport.

**Restrictions**: Humans can be any class they desire. To be a human, your ability scores must all be nine or above. Weapon and Armor is also no issue to a human.

**Perks**: As Humans can adjust to nearly anything swiftly, they gain a 10% bonus to any experience gained.

### Lycankind
Most Lycankind are still classified as Shadows of Despair. However, those who are taken into Wardenship do find their skills useful. When selecting this race, select either Bear, Tiger, or Wolf. This is the form you assume when shifted into animal form.

**Restrictions**: Animal forms only last 2d4 turns in combat. A Lycankind can not wear armor of any kind. A Lycankind must have a Strength and a Dexterity of at least 13. When in human form, Lycankind prefer ranged weaponry. When shifted, they use natural weaponry at their rolled ability bonus.

**Perks**: When shifted, your armor class becomes similar to that of the respective "Lycanthrope" creature, found in the Monsters section of the Basic Fantasy RPG rulebook, on pages 102-103. Your attacks also become such.

### Dhampir
The forbidden offspring between Humans and Vampires. Often leaning towards chaotic and forge their own path from there. Afflicted with a vampire's celerity, strength, and bloodlust; however can be harmed by normal weapons.

**Restrictions**: With the vampiric bloodlust circulating in their syste, Dhampir can not have a Constitution Score higher than 15. They also must have a Dexterity of nine or more. Dhampir, due to their speed, are best unarmed or with bows. Also, they may not roll any die higher than a d6 when resolving HP gains, regardless of class taken. As for classes, Dhampir prefer to be Rangers or Thieves

**Perks**: Dhampir get a +1 to Dexterity and to Death Ray/Poison saving throws.

### Nephilim
The offspring between the Angelic and Humans from long ago. The offspring of these offspring will always be Nephilim and align heavily against the Shadows of Despair. One can tell them apart from normal humans from their glowing eyes in battle against these foul monsters.

**Restrictions**: Nephilim are best as Rangers or Fighters. They also have to have a strength and charisma of at least nine, with a Wisdom limit of 17.

**Perks**: Due to their heritage of being related to what some may see as messengers of divine will, Nephilim can muster the divine energy within to Turn Undead as a Level 1 Cleric starting at Level 3. See the core rulebook, page 50 for the table on turning undead.

## Classes
Most of the classes are played as is, with the exception of Cleric and Magic-User. Due to the constraints of the setting, these classes do not exist. Instead, Fighters and Thieves will be able to use Magic via the use of Cesarium, a commonly found crystal that reflects the environment where it was grown in both color and effect. More on Cesarium can be found later.

This setting was written with the use of the [Ranger](https://basicfantasy.org/downloads/BF-Rangers-and-Paladins-r4.pdf) and [Scout](https://basicfantasy.org/downloads/BF-Scouts-Supplement-r4.pdf) subclasses and [Assassin](https://basicfantasy.org/downloads/BF-Assassins-Supplement-r5.pdf) in addition to Thief and Fighter in mind. Each supplement is also hyperlinked above and can be found on the downloads page of basicfantasy.org. If your GM permits, you might be able to use any other *non-magic* using class.
