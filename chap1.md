# Chapter 1: The World That Remains
## Introduction
The World that Remains is a unique Urban Fantasy setting for Chris Gonnerman's *Basic Fantasy RPG* taking inspiration from a certain video game adaptation of Bram Stoker's *Dracula* (whose second game "borrowed" boxart from the cover of a game module whose catagorical identification is I6) and an American web cartoon series where the main power source is brightly colored crystallized magic. In this setting, you will go up against both the forces of evil in any form they take. This supplement relies off of the Basic Fantasy Core Rules, the PDF is found for free at basicfantasy.org.

## The World Itself
Life sprung up from the dust of the world and to the dust they shall return. With the advent of the emotion of hope came that of despair. Manifesting as the demons we call The Shadows of Despair, these monsters are numerous - from the Angel to the Vampire. However, not all of the Shadows stick to feeding off of the hope. Recognizing the danger that exists for the normal beings of the land, the Angels, the Lycankind, and some of the Vampires teamed up with humans to form the Wardens, a task force of men and women from around the world, regardless of race, to ensure that the balance between Light and Darkness is maintained.

### The City of Beacon's Cross
The crown jewel of the Autumnal Republic, this city is home to the famed Beacon's Cross Wardens and it's associated academy system. In addition to the Wardens is the Chapel, a sprawlingly large building in the center of the city. The original Chapel was once the target of a large Shadows-Alligned group of Lycankind known as the Wolf's Snarl. In addition, Raw Cesarium thefts have been on the rise and no one can quite pinpoint who or why. The Wardens of Beacon's Cross have been working on this case tirelessly in order to halt the crime and ensure peace and balance exist once more.
