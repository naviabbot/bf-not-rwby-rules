Cesarium is a crystalline material that was observed as entering from the planet's orbit. These crystals were classified as blank until they landed in some form of element - Earth Cesarium became Earth by landing and embedding itself in the ground, Fire came to be when it hurled itself from the orbit into a wildfire. Water became such when it plunged into the ocean and air so happened to form when it was swept up by a passing tornado.

And thus, the Beacon's Cross Hydroponics Factory was opened under the Chapel.
